This is a personal project with the main goal of developing my React and front-end skills while allowing me to practice and maintain my back-end/database skills. 

Tech Stack:
- React.js for front-end components and dynamic rendering
- Node.js/Express.js for server hosting and handling RESTful API requests between the front-end, the database, and the back-end data operations
- SQLite for a simple, mobile friendly database

The development of this project was broken into 4 sprints:
- Sprint 1 of this project was focused on developing a minimum viable product (MVP) for proof of concept and to guide the development of the full application. This MVP version was an entirely front-end, client-based application with basic functionalities implemented.
- Sprint 2 of this project was the largest sprint, focused on developing the model-view-controller (MVC) structure using React components in the front-end for views/user interfaces, an Express.js server with a custom REStful API as the controller, and database schemas and server-side data manipulation functions as the model.
- Sprint 3 will be focused on creating the AI recognition model to scan user images, determine the cards, columns, and numbers on each sheet, and convert the data to the format specified in the database schema. All cards determined using AI will then pass through a user-validated input form, allowing the user to quickly correct any potential errors in the model's recognition.
- Sprint 4 will be focused on developing the mobile version of the application, fully realizing the original vision for this project and allowing user's to manage large quantities of bingo cards quickly, giving them a competitive edge and allowing them to focus more on the people with them than the game itself
